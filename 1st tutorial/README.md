IDE  is an Intergreated Devolpment Environment which is an environment which has all the tools that can be used to make applications in this case.
### Why Visual Studio Code ?
In this video we are using VS code as an IDE not Pycharm or Visual Studio because Pycharm community version which is the free version can only program Python and HTML but we will also learn C++ and other languages. So we would have to switch IDEs and learn about two IDEs and We are not using Visual Studio because it is not lightweight while VS code is really lightweight.
